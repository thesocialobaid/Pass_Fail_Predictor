# Pass_Fail_Predictor

## Overview 
Built a supervised classification model that predicts whether a student is likely to pass or fail based on two behavioral features: Study Hours and Sleep Hours. This project demonstrates the practical application of logistic regression, feature scaling, and model evaluation in a minimal yet insightful dataset. Aimed at showcasing how simple input features can still yield valuable predictive insights.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack: 

Python â€“ Core language for data preprocessing and model training
NumPy & Pandas â€“ Used for efficient data manipulation and analysis
Seaborn â€“ Enabled clear and informative data visualizations
Scikit-learn â€“ Applied logistic regression, feature scaling, and model evaluation techniques

## ðŸ§© System Architecture: 
1. Data Collection â†’ 2. Preprocessing â†’ 3. Model Training â†’ 4. Evaluation & Visualization

Data Collection: Small structured dataset consisting of two features: study hours and sleep hours per student, with a binary output (Pass/Fail).

Preprocessing: Cleaned and scaled features using StandardScaler to normalize input values and improve model performance.

Model Training: Employed logistic regression with class weights set to balanced to handle potential class imbalance and increase generalization.

Evaluation & Visualization: Used metrics like accuracy and visual tools (e.g., scatter plots, decision boundaries) to evaluate and interpret model predictions.
